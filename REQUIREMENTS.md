# Some ways we might expect the system to work

1. interact with prompts in a "chat bot" manner to collect the required information
2. questions asked are based on collection of rules
3. any benefits the user may qualify for are included in the response
4. if there are no eligible benefits we do not provide reasons why
5. if some benefits can not be determined without additional information additional queries can be made
6. leverage sentiment analysis to meet the user "where they are" and/or respond accordingly during the engagement
7. use a database of benefits and a rules engine to create the {{ questions }} and output the {{ answers }} without the need of generating forms
