# Some ways we expect the system to work

1. interact with prompts in a "chat bot" manner to collect the required information
2. questions asked are based on collection of rules
3. any benefits the user may qualify for are included in the response
4. if there are no eligible benefits we do not provide reasons why
5. if some benefits can not be determined without additional information additional queries can be made
